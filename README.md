This code is to demonstrate the semi complex theory version of Hurst value to distinguish AD from normal brain wave. The Hurst exponent is used as a measure of long-term memory of time series. It relates to the autocorrelations of the time series, and the rate at which these decrease as the lag between pairs of values increases. The AD patient seems to have larger Hurst, but neeeds more verification.
